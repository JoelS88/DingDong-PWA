# DingDong-PWA

This project has now been superseded by <a href="https://github.com/Jollus88/Winning-Smash4" target="_blank">Winning at Smash 4</a>, a similar but enhanced PWA. Try it out <a href="https://winningatsmash4.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

**This is a Progressive Web App for calculating Donkey Kong Ding Dong Percents in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.**

It's single page application that runs on JS frameworks, and utilises the Knockout.js and Jquery libraries. This is not a native mobile app that can be downloaded from an App Store, but contains similar functions and provides the same user experience and benefits.

The PWA features are now available, and the website can be downloaded to a mobile or tablet device for quick reference and offline viewing.

All raw percent values and formulas have been adopted from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OvUy2gsTrUj96cAHSkSIZHGnUaaS-UrX6SdFKyctNmU/edit#gid=932844731" target="_blank">DK Doc</a> labbed by <a href="https://twitter.com/thevondk" target="_blank">Poke</a>.
